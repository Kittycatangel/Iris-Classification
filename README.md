# Flower Classification

## Goal

We are in nature hiking and we want to explore diffrent flowers. We want to build a machine learning model that can classify the type of flower given its petal and septal dimensions.

## Outcome

We built a K- nearset neighbor model that can accurately predict with 97% of the time the type of the flower.

Great, now let's go exploring in the nature.
